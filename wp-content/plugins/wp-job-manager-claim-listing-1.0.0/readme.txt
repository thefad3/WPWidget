Let users claim listings on your website! Let them claim for free or paid!

This plugin adds a 'Claim this listing' text link at the top of a listing. This link allows people to claim a listing if they want to be the owner of it.

Claiming a listing can be free or paid. When claiming is paid, you can set a WooCommerce product that users need to buy before the claim comes through.

Claims can be easily managed from the WordPress admin area.
